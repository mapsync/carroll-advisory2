  Our maintenance crews will be out the next few days flushing water mains and
  taking samples. We routinely do distribution system flushing twice a year and
  it is that time of year. We will be flowing water at speeds of 2.5 feet per
  second to scour the internal walls of the pipe and then slowly lower the
  velocity. This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your water.

  Our source water is one of the best aquifers in the world. It DOES NOT come from the surface of the Ohio or Kentucky River. It is an underground well water source so therefore it has some (healthy) minerals for your body!! Drink with confidence, water is good for you!

  Please call if you have any questions or concerns! Thank you
