  This is a friendly notice that our technicians will be out collecting meter
  readings electronically on today March 15th, 2024. We hope that everyone had
  minimal damage with this crazy weather lately! As you are cleaning up, please
  remember cleaning up the area around your meter so our technicians can
  manually inspect the meter pit and get manual readings if need be.


  Inspecting meter pits for illegal activity and damages will allow us to keep rates down. Any illegal activity or damages that is found will be added to the account, along with additional service fees and will be fully prosecuted with local, state, and homeland security, based on the severity of tampering with a public water supply. Please report any suspicious and all illegal activity. In advance, thank you!
