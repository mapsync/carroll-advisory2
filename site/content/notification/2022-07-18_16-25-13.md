  CCWD New Water Rates Effective after 12 years!


  After twelve years, CCWD must increase water rates and restructure their service fees. The new rates on an average water bill being 4,000 gallons of water increases from $36.00 to $40.20 for an 11.7% increase.(That is pretty amazing if you think about it. Less than 1 percent per year since last change.)


  We have restructured our service fees to create an incentive program to allow for better efficiency and streamline work flows at a ‘scheduled’ discount cost. If you expect our normal operations to be interrupted then there will be higher charge.


  CCWD is a non-profit and stand alone utility that continues to proudly serve quality potable water at a great price for all of its customers in Carroll, Gallatin and Owen counties.
