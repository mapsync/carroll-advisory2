  As part of our commitment to providing exceptional services to our customers,
  this Saturday evening our credit card data center will be executing a planned
  data center failover test, migrating applications from our primary data center
  to our secondary data center and back to the primary. The purpose of this test
  will be to exercise their failover procedures and confirm standard
  functionality.  This is only a test to verify the backup system will work if
  in case it is ever needed.  During this down time of midnight to 0400 EST on
  September 27th, if trying to pay by credit card, you will have to process
  payment a later time.  


  Remember, you have the option to avoid credit card fees by signing up for the free, no monthly service fees through an Auto Draft payment that can be arranged through our office.  Please call us for more details.


  We would also like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a safe good weekend!
