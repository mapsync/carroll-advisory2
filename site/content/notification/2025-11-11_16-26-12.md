  There aren’t enough words to show our gratitude for all the troops who have
  served and are currently serving our country.  We owe so much to them, and
  they are our heroes!  Let us never forget to pray for them and their
  families.  Let us never forget the sacrifices they have made for us! 

  To all the Veterans out there, we honor, respect and support you!


  From the Staff at Carroll County Water District #1, we thank you for your service.
