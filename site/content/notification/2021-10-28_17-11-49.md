  CCWD has printed the 11/1/2021 bill cards for the water usage cycle for the
  9/15 thru 10/15.    Bill cards should be in the mailboxes early next
  week.  Please call the USPS office if you do not receive your bill by the end
  of the week!! This way the postmaster is aware of their issue and can make
  adjustments to enhance their services.  You can call us to request  your
  account balance to proceed with timely payment.  Please pay early to avoid
  late fees and/or being disconnected!


  Also, call to ask about our no cost auto draft payment.  Avoid the hassle of USPS and the inconvenience of getting out.  


  Thank you!
