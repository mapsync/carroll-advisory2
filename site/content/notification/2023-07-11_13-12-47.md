  The Division of Water (DOW) congratulates Kentucky water systems for being
  recognized for their great work producing high-quality water. The article “As
  Americans Focus on Water Quality, These States Boast the Best” published by
  J.D. Power, evaluated drinking water service in six areas, and ranked Kentucky
  as No. 1 in the nation. While the study focused on large water systems, DOW
  knows that many other systems across the state also overcome obstacles
  year-round to provide consistent access to clean, healthy drinking water. 


  The six areas evaluated in the poll are:

  •	quality and reliability

  •	price

  •	conservation

  •	billing and payment

  •	communications

  •	customer service

  Division of Water is proud to work with Kentucky’s drinking water operators and managers who provide such an important resource to the Commonwealth.
