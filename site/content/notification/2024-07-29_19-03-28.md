  Carroll County Water District #1 would like to advise residents of Owen County
  and more particular in the area along Hwy 355 from Perry Park to Gratz,
  Squiresville Rd and the spurs of this road, that due to scheduled preventative
  work and a thorough cleaning a storage tank, residence may experience lower
  water pressure than normal. (Most customers may NOT experience any pressure
  change at all)


  Carroll County Water District #1 is diligently working to maintain adequate water pressure will complete this task within this week.


  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience.


  Thank you!!!!
