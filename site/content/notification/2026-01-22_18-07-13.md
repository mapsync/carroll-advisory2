  frigid temperatures, please remember to do the following through the night and
  even during the DAY!!!!


  * Make sure you know where your Shutoff Valve is in your home.

  * Leave a slow drip in bathroom or kitchen, whichever is the furthest away from the meter.

  * Open cabinet doors to let the warmth in your home to warm those pipes a little more.

  * When cold weather hits, if possible, please keep the lid on the meter pit to avoid a flash freeze.
