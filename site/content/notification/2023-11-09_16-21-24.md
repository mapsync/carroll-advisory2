  O﻿ur maintenance crews will be out for the next few days flushing water mains
  and taking samples.  We routinely do distribution system flushing twice a year
  and it is that time of year.  We will be flowing water at speeds of 2.5 feet
  per second to scour the internal walls of the pipe and then dump water to
  lower velocities.  This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your
  water.  Our source water is one of the best aquifers in the world.  It is well
  water so therefore it does build/scale of some minerals. (Tidbit: If you live
  in an older home, the plumbing pipes may have the same kind of
  buildup.  Unfortunately, most residential plumbing is not designed to allow a
  self cleaning scouring flush which is the 2.5 feet per second.)



  Please call if you have any questions or concerns.
