  This is a friendly notice that our technicians will be out collecting meter
  readings electronically on February 15th, 2024.  We also make routine
  inspections on this day and randomly throughout the month.  Please make sure
  animals and debris are clear from the area around your meter to allow our
  staff to collect any manual readings and inspect meter pits.  


  Inspecting meter pits for illegal activity and damages will allow us to keep rates down. Any illegal activity or damages that is found will be added to the account, along with additional service fees and will be fully prosecuted with local, state, and homeland security, based on the severity of tampering with a public water supply. Please report any suspicious and all illegal activity.  In advance, Thank you!
