  As temperatures drop into the single digits and below it is important to take
  precautions to avoid having your water lines freeze.


  1﻿. Allow your water to run at a steady drip from your faucets, this keeps the water moving and less likely to freeze. Do this even during the day with extreme temperatures.


  2﻿. ** DO NOT** remove the lid from your meter vault, this will cause it to freeze.


  3﻿. If necessary, you may cover your meter with blankets and rugs.


  Stay safe and warm! Remember to check on your neighbors as well as outside pets
