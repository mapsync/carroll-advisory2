  This is a friendly notice that our technicians will be out collecting meter
  readings electronically this Friday March 14th, 2025. As you get out and start
  doing yard work during this beautiful weather, please remember cleaning up the
  area around your meter so our technicians can manually inspect the meter pit
  and get manual readings if need be.


  Inspecting meter pits for illegal activity and damages will allow us to keep rates down. Any illegal activity or damages that is found will be added to the account, along with additional service fees and will be fully prosecuted with local, state, and homeland security, based on the severity of tampering with a public water supply. Please report any suspicious and all illegal activity. In advance, thank you!


  P.S Don’t forget to call our office to locate our water lines for any digging you may be doing!
