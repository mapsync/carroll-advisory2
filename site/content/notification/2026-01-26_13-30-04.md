  Due to inclement weather, our office will be closed Monday, January 26, 2026.
  Office staff will be working remotely. If you need assistance or have any
  questions, please call 502-347-9500. Our staff will be available to assist
  you!


  If you need to make a payment by phone, please call 866-612-4915. Due to current road conditions Carroll County is under a Level 3 snow emergency, meaning that all roads are closed for non-essential travel. Only emergency responders, essential personnel and those with a true emergency should be on the roads at this time. Staying off the roadways helps keep the first responders safe and allows crews to continue snow removal efforts. 


  If you are located nearby and would like to drop off your payment you may do so at either drop box located on either side of the building. 


  We apologize for any inconvenience!
