As temperatures drop into the single digits and below it is important to take precautions to avoid having your water lines freeze.

1 . Allow your water to run at a steady drip from your faucets, this keeps the water moving and less likely to freeze. Do this even during the day with extreme temperatures.

2 . \*\* DO NOT\*\* remove the lid from your meter vault, this will cause it to freeze.

3 . If necessary, you may cover your meter with blankets and rugs.

Stay safe and warm! Remember to check on your neighbors as well as outside pets
