Our maintenance crews will be out flushing water mains and taking samples in Owen County.  We routinely do distribution system flushing twice a year.  We will be flowing water at speeds of 2.5 feet per second to scour the internal walls of the pipe and then dump water at lower velocities. This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your water.  Have a great day!
