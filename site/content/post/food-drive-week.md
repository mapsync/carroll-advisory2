This week (11/15/2021) is Food Drive Week for the Local Food Pantries.  Carroll County Water has a collection box located in the lobby for anyone wanting to donate goods for families with needs.  **Get in the holiday mood; donate some food.  THANKS** for **GIVING** food!  

Let's put some goods in the back of the cruiser for a change!!!
