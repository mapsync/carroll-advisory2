Carroll County Water District will be flushing lines in the Owen County service area.

Our maintenance crews will be out for the next few days flushing water mains and taking samples. We routinely do distribution system flushing twice a year and it is that time of the year. We will be flowing water at speeds of 2.5 feet per second to scour the internal walls of the pipe and then dump water at lower velocities. This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your water. Our source water is one of the best aquifers in the world. It is well water so therefore it does build/scale of some minerals. (Tidbit: If you live in an older home, the plumbing pipes may have the same kind of buildup. Unfortunately, most residential plumbing is not designed to allow a self-clean scouring flush which is the 2.5 feet per second.)

Please call if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you!
