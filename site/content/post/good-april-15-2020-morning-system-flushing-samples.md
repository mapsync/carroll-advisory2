We wanted you to know that our maintenance crews will be out today and the next few days flushing water mains and taking water quality samples.  Our staff has been working every day to assure the water service continues to be steadily available to you.  We routinely do distribution system flushing twice a year and it is that time of the year.  We will be flowing water at speeds of 2.5 feet per second to scour the internal walls of the pipe and then dump water at lower velocities.  This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your water.Our source water is one of the best aquifers in the world.  It is well water so therefore it does build/scale of some minerals.  (Tidbit:  If you live in an older home, the plumbing pipes may have the same kind of buildup.  Unfortunately, most residential plumbing is not designed to allow a self-clean scouring flush which is the 2.5 feet per second.)

Today we are scheduled to start flushing and collecting water quality samples.  This will take a few days to complete as we are spread out in three different counties.  If you see our service truck in the neighborhood, please give them a thumbs up to show your appreciation for them being an essential worker!  We wish you well and please call if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you!
