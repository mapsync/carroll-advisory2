description: CCWD WILL BE DOING ROUTINE FLUSHING OF WATER LINES IN HUNTERS RIDGE SUBDIVISION
---


Carroll County Water District will be doing routine flushing of lines in the Hunters Ridge Subdivision.

This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your water, please be patient as it is well water so therefore it contains minerals that build up over time. 

Please call if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you!
