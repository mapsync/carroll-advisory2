I﻿f you have not received your bill card in the mail please feel free to call the office at 502-347-9500 and we would be more than happy to let you know what your account balance is. Late fees are applied to past due accounts as of March 21, so you still have plenty of time to get your payments in and avoid late charges.  We hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!
