P﻿lease remember that when you receive your Janurary billcard (which was mailed out today, December 29, 2022) it will NOT reflect any usage from letting your water drip during the recent artic blast, that will be reflected on your February bill card. 

W﻿e would also like to remind everyone who may have a secondary residence to go and check your plumbing and make sure everything is working as it should be.  Once again, HAPPY NEW YEAR!
