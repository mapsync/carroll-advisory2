Remember to protect those pipes to avoid a major headache later. With the frigid temperatures, please remember to do the following through the night and even during the DAY!!!!

\* Make sure you know where your Shutoff Valve is in your home.

\* Leave a slow drip in bathroom or kitchen, whichever is the furthest away from the entry point of your water line in your crawlspace to keep water flowing throughout the home.

\* Open cabinet doors to let the warmth in your home to warm those pipes a little more.

\* Do not open the meter pit unless it’s an extreme emergency such as flooding in your home and your shutoff valve isn’t working properly. If this is the case, you enter the meter pit at your own risk of being responsible for all damage to CCWD’s meter base. Please be prepared to insulate the meter pit once the water is turned off. Insulation can be an old blanket, rug or old insulation that can be placed around the meter in the pit to protect the meter from flash freeze. Once the meter lid is placed back on the vault properly, place snow back on top of meter to provide additional insulation/warmth.

\* If you have any issues and you need immediate assistance, please call 502-347-9500, when prompted choose the option for the Emergency Mailbox or you may also call local dispatch. If you have any problems during normal business hours, please call the office 502-347-9500.
