1﻿.  Allow your water to run at a steady drip from your faucets, this keeps the water moving and less likely to freeze.  Do this even during the day with extreme temperatures. 

2﻿. ** DO NOT** remove the lid from your meter vault, this will cause it to freeze.

3﻿.  If necessary, you may cover your meter with blankets and rugs.  

S﻿tay safe and warm!  Remember to check on your neighbors as well as outside pets.
