This is a friendly notice that our technicians will be out collecting meter readings electronically tomorrow June 14th, 2024. As you are out enjoying this beautiful weather, please remember the area around your meter! Please make sure the area is free of debris so our technicians can manually inspect the meter pit and get manual readings if need be.

Inspecting meter pits for illegal activity and damages will allow us to keep rates down. Any illegal activity or damages that is found will be added to the account, along with additional service fees and will be fully prosecuted with local, state, and homeland security, based on the severity of tampering with a public water supply. Please report any suspicious and all illegal activity. In advance, thank you!
