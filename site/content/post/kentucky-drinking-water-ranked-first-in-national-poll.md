description: Kentucky Drinking Water Ranked First in National Poll
---
The Division of Water (DOW) congratulates Kentucky water systems for being recognized for their great work producing high-quality water. The article “[As Americans Focus on Water Quality, These States Boast the Best](https://www.jdpower.com/business/resources/as-Americans-focus-on-water-these-states-boast-the-best)” published by J.D. Power, evaluated drinking water service in six areas, and ranked Kentucky as No. 1 in the nation. While the study focused on large water systems, DOW knows that many other systems across the state also overcome obstacles year-round to provide consistent access to clean, healthy drinking water.



The six areas evaluated in the poll are:

* quality and reliability
* price
* conservation
* billing and payment
* communications
* customer service

Division of Water is proud to work with Kentucky’s drinking water operators and managers who provide such an important resource to the Commonwealth
