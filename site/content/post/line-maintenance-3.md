Our crew will be performing line maintenance on Crittenden Street in Gratz today. You may experience low pressure/no water for a short period of time. While the entire area will not experience these issues, customers from the 500-700 blocks of Crittenden Street and Hwy 22 are expected to experience an outage. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any questions feel free to contact our office at 502-347-9500.
