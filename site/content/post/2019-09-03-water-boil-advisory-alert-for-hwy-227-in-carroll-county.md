A Boil Water Advisory is being issued by Carroll County Water District # 1 until further notice.  Currently, we are working to restore water as soon as possible.  The affected area is located on Hwy. 227 near the interstate area from Early Floyd Dealership to the north of Exit 44 being block of 2500 through 3500.    

This is a precautionary measure!  This action has become necessary to allow us to make a proper repair on a water main that was damaged by another utility's contractor (Spectrum).    It is recommended that you boil the water used for drinking at a rolling boil for three minutes prior to consumption.

We apologize for any inconveniences this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding of this situation.  

This advisory is until further notice.  If you have any questions, please call the office.  Thank you.
