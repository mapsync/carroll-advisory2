There aren’t enough words to show our gratitude for all the troops who have served and are currently serving our country. We owe so much to them, and they are our heroes! Let us never forget to pray for them and their families. Let us never forget the sacrifices they have made for us!

To all the Veterans out there, we honor, respect and support you!



From the Staff at Carroll County Water District #1, we thank you for your service.
