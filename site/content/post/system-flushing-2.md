O﻿ur maintenance crews will be out the next few days flushing water mains and taking samples. We routinely do distribution system flushing twice a year and it is that time of year!  We will be flowing water at speeds of 2.5 feet per second to scour the internal walls of the pipe and then slowly lower the velocity.  This may cause some temporary cloudiness in your water.  

O﻿ur source water is one of the best aquifers in the world. It DOES NOT come from the surface of the Ohio or Kentucky River.  It is an underground well water source so therefore it has some (healthy) minerals for your body!! Drink with confidence, water is good for you! 

Please call if you have any questions or concerns!
